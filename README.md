# Python-Tools-Wasm

Currently just contains a simple interface to use [pycdc and pycdas](https://github.com/zrax/pycdc/) in the browser. 
I would like to figure out how to get this working without needing to modify the c++ code but I havent done that yet so it's messy and hacky but it does work.
.pyc files can be disassembled/decompiled completly in the browser entirely client side.

This is very much unfinished, I just wanted it to be accessible on github, mostly for my own convienience.
